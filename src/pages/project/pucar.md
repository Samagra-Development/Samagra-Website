overview:
  - text: India’s judicial system struggles with efficiency, burdened by over 5
      crore pending cases, including 4.3 crore in lower courts alone. With over
      70 lakh new cases filed annually and a judge-to-population ratio of just
      21 per million (far below the recommended 50), disposal rates can’t keep
      up. Vacant judicial positions, procedural delays, frequent adjournments,
      and manual workflows further slow case resolution. At the current pace,
      clearing the backlog would take 300+ years, denying timely justice,
      eroding public trust, and harming economic growth by delaying contract
      enforcement and dispute resolution. In 2023, a diverse group of
      professionals and organizations came together to address the deep-rooted
      stagnation in dispute resolution—where outdated processes and capacity
      constraints have left millions frustrated and disillusioned. This
      collaboration gave rise to the Public Collective for Avoidance and
      Resolution of Disputes (PUCAR), a movement dedicated to harnesses
      imagination, volunteer-driven energy, and collective expertise to
      reimagine and revitalize dispute resolution in India. Anchored by Agami,
      XKDR, eGov Foundation and Samagra, PUCAR is working in collaboration with
      the Karnataka and Kerala high courts and the Supreme Courts e-committee to
      operationalize a special court—24x7 OnCourts—for cases under NIA Section
      138 (cheque bounce cases), which constitute a significant portion of
      pending litigation, accounting for 10% of all pending cases. The 24x7 ON
      Courts initiative aims to create a faster, more accessible, and
      citizen-centric judicial system by leveraging technology to streamline
      case resolution. Its intended outcome is to reduce pendency, enhance
      transparency, and ensure timely justice for all.

approach:
  - text: Samagra, through PUCAR, is working with the judiciary, government, legal
      experts, and technology partners to make dispute resolution faster, more
      transparent, and citizen-friendly. A pilot court for cheque bounce cases
      is being set up in Kollam, Kerala, as a proof of concept to test and
      refine new approaches. This includes enabling verifiable digital evidence
      for seamless document authentication, expanding state-wide digital
      jurisdiction to allow virtual case handling, and implementing rule-based
      processes to streamline filings, summons, and hearings. Additionally,
      multi-channel communication will keep litigants informed, asynchronous
      proceedings will reduce scheduling bottlenecks. Judges, court staff, and
      advocates will receive training to ensure smooth implementation, while
      courtrooms will be redesigned for efficiency with paperless operations and
      virtual hearings. The pilot’s impact will be measured through data
      comparisons and stakeholder feedback to assess its success. The initiative
      follows a two-pronged approach—introducing nationwide technology and
      policy reforms while making practical courtroom-level improvements that
      can be replicated across states. Lessons from this pilot will shape a
      playbook and a shared digital infrastructure, making it easier for other
      courts to adopt similar changes. By combining better processes, smart
      technology, and policy refinements, PUCAR and OnCourts aim to create a
      judicial system that is more accessible, efficient, and responsive to
      citizens’ needs.
