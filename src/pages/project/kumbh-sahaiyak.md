      unprecedented scale. To ensure timely, unbiased, and verified information,
      academic experts were onboarded to validate content, guaranteeing both
      accuracy and cultural alignment. Real-time feedback from users was
      collected, enabling continuous updates to enhance the relevance of
      responses. "
  - text: "Accuracy Improvement : Bhashini, an initiative by the Ministry of
      Electronics and IT, was entrusted with refining translation and
      transliteration models in multiple languages. Krutrim powered the
      chatbot’s core intelligence with advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
      ensuring that queries were classified correctly, relevant information sets
      were retrieved, and accurate responses were provided. Given the diverse
      visitor base expected at Mahakumbh 2025, WhatsApp was enabled as a
      communication channel for pilgrims."

      experience. Kumbh Sah’AI’yak aims to redefine pilgrim assistance by
