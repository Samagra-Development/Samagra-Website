overview:
  - text: Samagra, with support from Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is working
      with the Government of UP to enable department officers with timely
      visibility on status & quality of implementation for each scheme.
      Farm-level data will also help them identify archetypes of farmers and
      provide them with services customised to their individual needs. This
      essentially would set up the foundations for any agricultural reform that
      the state wants to undertake in the future.

approach:
  - text: Samagraâ€™s approach in making the department of agriculture battle ready to
      implement any reform in the sector is through setting up data pipelines
      that will help in identifying farmer archetypes and provide them services
      and products tailored to their immediate needs on the farm. Data-backed
      decision making systems would also help the department while conducting
      reviews at each cascade (state > district > block). Better visibility on
      where scheme implementation or adoption is getting bottlenecked will help
      in more targeted problem solving.This would be supplemented by a Krushi
      Samiksha Kendra, an integrated command and control centre for the
      government, through which it can send nudges to ground cadres to achieve
      targets, push weather/pest alerts to farmers, and conduct surveys to take
      inputs from ground on a time-to-time basis.
