overview:
  - text: In 2019, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE)
      released its Vision 2025 document. This was an effort towards outlining a
      forward-looking vision that lays out the strategic priorities for the
      Ministry in the coming five years, corresponding opportunity areas and a
      framework to help prioritise them. Starting in November 2019, Samagraâ€™s
      Skill India team started working with MSDE to help convert this vision
      into an action plan for implementation.

approach:
  - text: Based on insights from the Vision 2025 document, consultations with
      ministry officials and subject matter experts, data analysis and extensive
      field visits, the team identified 20 initiatives for implementation. The
      ownership of each of these initiatives rested with a senior official
      within MSDE with whom Samagra co-worked to design the initiatives.
      Further, the team supported the senior leadership at MSDE to embed the
      implementation plans of all the initiatives into the Government of India's
      Sectoral Group milestones. Sectoral groups are led by Secretaries of
      Ministries which share a common sector and collaborate to implement a
      cohesive strategy.
