overview:
  - text: Having developed a comprehensive playbook for agricultural transformation
      in Odisha, it was time to take the learnings national — with Maharashtra
      leading the way. Samagra, with support from the Gates Foundation, is
      partnering with the Department of Agriculture, Government of Maharashtra,
      to enhance scheme and service delivery systems and streamline the state’s
      digital advisory ecosystem.
  - text: By integrating currently siloed systems, these interventions aim to enable
      data-backed decision-making and lay the foundation for future agricultural
      reforms in the state.

approach:
  - text: Samagra’s approach to make the department battle-ready for large-scale
      transformation is three-pronged — institutionalising high-quality,
      data-backed reviews of all agri-operations to drive accountability;
      designing a digital extension system with a farmer-first lens; and
      establishing a robust farmer query and grievance resolution mechanism.
  - text: Greater visibility into departmental operations will enable more targeted
      problem-solving and farmer communication based on identified cohorts.
      Closing the feedback loop with farmers will ensure a seamless experience
      in accessing schemes and services, strengthen trust in the department, and
      make farmers feel truly empowered.
