overview:
  - text: SUBHADRA Plus is a flagship initiative of the Department of Women and
      Child Development (W&CD), Government of Odisha, aimed at creating an
      enabling ecosystem to unlock earning pathways for women by 2029. Building
      on the success of SUBHADRA, the state’s ₹11,000 crore financial inclusion
      scheme that provides direct monetary assistance to over one crore women,
      SUBHADRA Plus shifts the focus from short-term financial support to
      long-term economic empowerment. Anchored within a vast grassroots delivery
      network of 74,000+ Anganwadi Workers and supported by a strong
      administrative hierarchy, the program aspires to transform women’s
      financial agency into sustainable livelihoods.

approach:
  - text: The program’s approach rests on seven interconnected pillars designed to
      strengthen women’s participation in the economy. It begins with SUBHADRA
      Samikhya, a study assessing fund utilization and financial
      decision-making, followed by database strengthening to establish a
      livelihood baseline for all beneficiaries. Employment creation forms the
      core — through SUBHADRA Niwas hostels improving mobility, partnerships
      with line departments to identify job opportunities, and enterprise
      promotion among adolescent girls and destitute women. A dedicated Steering
      Committee ensures inter-departmental coordination, while a state-wide
      Outreach Strategy drives awareness and engagement. Together, these pillars
      form a comprehensive framework for women’s empowerment that combines
      financial inclusion, employment generation, and social transformation
