overview:
  - text: The Family Benefit Management System (FBMS) is envisioned as a unified,
      high-confidence platform for welfare delivery in Andhra Pradesh. It aims
      to achieve 100 percent benefit saturation with minimal misdirection by
      March 2027, enabling proactive, data-driven inclusion of eligible families
      while curbing leakages. Building on the state’s strong foundation of
      digital governance and its comprehensive GSWS Household Database covering
      1.69 crore families, FBMS seeks to make this the single source of truth
      for all departments.
  - text: he objectives are three-fold — (1) to enrich and reconcile household data
      dynamically across departments; (2) to determine and update eligibility
      through analytics, life-event triggers, and periodic reviews; and (3) to
      deliver benefits transparently to citizens via digital interfaces.
  - text: Samagra is co-working with the Government of Andhra Pradesh on four major
      aspects — (1) to strengthen the Family Database by linking 20 departmental
      data sources and ensuring field saturation with high-confidence data; (2)
      to operationalize an Analytics Engine that recalculates eligibility,
      detects anomalies, and drives enrol-or-exit instructions; (3) to
      streamline Eligibility Enablers by simplifying revenue-certificate
      workflows and developing a credible income/vulnerability algorithm; and
      (4) to enable Proactive Saturation through event-triggered and periodic
      analytics integrated with departmental systems.

approach:
  - text: The Family Benefit Management System (FBMS) follows an implementation
      framework anchored in three pillars – Enablers, Tools, and Outcomes. The
      Enablers form the foundation, beginning with the creation of a unified
      Family Database that consolidates information from 20 departmental
      systems. Each data field is populated through a “golden source” or
      validated proxy, ensuring high-confidence, Aadhaar-authenticated records.
      This is complemented by an Analytics Engine that serves as the
      computational core—constantly recalculating eligibility, detecting
      anomalies, and triggering enrol-or-exit actions based on life events or
      periodic updates. The third enabler, Eligibility Determination, simplifies
      the process of availing welfare benefits by using clear exclusion criteria
      and automated revenue-certificate workflows, while progressively shifting
      toward an income-based vulnerability algorithm.
