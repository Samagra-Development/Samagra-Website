overview:
  - text: One of the biggest challenges facing our country is generating employment
      for its burgeoning workforce. To make its youth job-ready and able
      contributors to the economy, the Government of Haryana launched the
      Saksham Haryana-Skills and Employment programme to increase employment
      opportunities in the state and improve the quality of skilling. Samagra’s
      Saksham Haryana-Skills and Employment team works with the the Department
      of Employment and Department of Skill Development and Industrial Training
      to systemically transform the state’s employment and skilling domain.

approach:
  - text: Unemployment is a concern across states. In general, it manifests in three
      ways. First, there is no skilled manpower for the existing jobs in the
      market; second, both skilled manpower and jobs are available, but there
      are no linkages between the unemployed and job provider; and third, there
      is skilled manpower but no jobs in the market.
  - text: The government often intervenes in the third scenario by enabling
      investments from private sector. Saksham Haryana-Skills and Employment
      focuses on the first and second scenario. Through multiple initiatives
      cutting across the public and private sectors, the Saksham team is working
      with the government to equip youth with relevant skills needed to meet
      industry demands as well as link unemployed youth across the state to
      employment opportunities. These initiatives show immediate results and
      also have lesser financial implications for the government.

      text: Between 2017 and 2019, public sector recruitment has increased
        significantly in Haryana with over 60,000 appointments. No government in
        the state in the last two decades has been able to link as many people
        to public sector jobs. This is a noteworthy achievement not just because
        of the numbers involved but also because of the transparency in the
        process and emphasis on merit-based selection. For a state that had been
        riddled with corruption and “sifarish”-based recruitment, this was a
        paradigm shift. The period also saw the largest one-time recruitment of
        over 18,000 people to Group D government jobs. In November 2018, more
        than 17 lakh people applied for these jobs and criss-crossed across the
        state to write the recruitment exam. New trains had to be brought into
        service to facilitate this sudden increase in intra-state travel.

      text: To link youth to jobs, the Government of Haryana has entered into a unique
        collaborative partnership with cab aggregators, Ola and Uber. The
        essence of this partnership is that the government and private sector
        can collectively generate employment under a framework that ensures
        mutual benefit and no risk. In this case, the government wanted to
        increase employment while Ola and Uber were looking to expand the market
        for their services and hire more people. Within one year of the launch
        of the partnership, more than 55,000 youth in the state had been
        onboarded by both aggregators. At the same time, Ola and Uber have
        expanded their services in four districts of Haryana and are starting
        new services as well. But beyond the numbers, the partnership has also
        resulted in meaningful policy changes which have improved the ease of
        doing business for all operators in the market and not just Ola or Uber.
        Based on the success of this model, the Government has entered into
        similar partnerships with other aggregators such as Swiggy and Zomato.

      text: The Apprenticeship Act legislated in 1961 by the Union Government is
        largely underutilized by states. The Act mandates the appointment of
        apprentices in all establishments (government and private) with more
        than 40 employees. Haryana became the first state to put together a
        holistic strategy for its implementation, becoming the state with most
        number of apprentices appointed per lakh population. Till date, this
        position rests with Haryana. When the Saksham Haryana programme began in
        2017, the number of apprentices per lakh population was 87, currently it
        stands at over 270 and continues to rise.
