overview:
  - text: ADAPT-F&ARD is a partnership between the Government of Odisha, Bill &
      Melinda Gates Foundation and Samagra with the objective of increasing the
      income of farmers from Fisheries and Animal Husbandry. The project aims to
      empower the state to make data-backed policy decisions and improve the
      delivery of schemes. As part of the engagement, we are supporting the
      government in digitizing the delivery process of various schemes that the
      department provides to farmers ranging from subsidies for creation of fish
      ponds to promotion of fodder cultivation for livestock. The team is also
      working with International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) for
      creation of a 5-year and 15-year livestock masterplan for the state.

approach:
  - text: "Our approach to increasing the income of the farmers via fisheries and
      animal husbandry is focused on extensive use of data and technology to
      enable the state government to make informed decisions. A Decision Support
      System has been envisioned to integrate all livestock and
      fisheries-related data points available across multiple databases on a
      single online portal for officials. This enables the state department to
      make evidence-based policy decisions, ensure transparency in scheme
      delivery and effectively support farmers during the Fisheries and Animal
      Husbandry lifecycle. "
