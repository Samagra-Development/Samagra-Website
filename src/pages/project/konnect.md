overview:
  - text: "Samagra, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is
      working with the Government of Odisha to improve the income of farmers in
      the state. It intends to do this by making the markets work for the
      farmers and by enabling the agri-value chain to operate at a higher
      equilibrium. To this end, the program aims to reduce information asymmetry
      and increase the choices available to farmers. "

approach:
  - text: "Samagra’s approach to improving the income of farmers is to push for four
      core administrative and technical reforms. These include developing a tech
      platform to enable core interactions within the agricultural ecosystem,
      introducing farmer-centric initiatives across major steps of the value
      chain, putting in place enablers to drive adoption of the tech platform
      among farmers, ecosystem players and system actors, and lastly, sharply
      defining goals with regular income measurement. "
