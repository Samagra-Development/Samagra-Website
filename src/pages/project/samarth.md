overview:
  - text: Samarth is the Government of Himachal Pradesh’s flagship programme focused
      on improving the learning levels of students in government schools by
      systemically transforming the state’s education system. The Samarth
      engagement aspires to improve learning levels of students by 8-10
      percentage points, making at least 75% of students across elementary
      grades grade-level competent and establishing Himachal as one of the top 3
      states in the National Achievement Survey.

approach:
  - text: Samagra’s approach to transforming school education combines both academic
      and administrative reforms. This means we focus as much on improving the
      quality of classroom interactions between students and teachers (shifting
      focus from syllabus completion to competency-based teaching, encouraging
      innovative teaching practices, conducting high quality assessments), as on
      making the education system administratively more efficient (ensuring
      timely delivery of textbooks to schools, robust review and monitoring
      mechanisms, ongoing mentoring and training support for teachers).

keyInitiatives:
  - description:
      text: Previously, government schools in Himachal Pradesh experienced an average
        delay of up to 137 days in the delivery of textbooks. This resulted in
        loss of teaching time, thereby adversely affecting the learning process.
        There were multiple administrative issues resulting in delayed textbook
        delivery such as logistical gaps, slow communication channels, unclear
        roles and responsibilities and consequently lack of accountability for
        unmet deadlines. In 2016, the Department of Elementary Education (DEE),
        Himachal Pradesh embarked on a mission to ensure timely delivery of
        textbooks across the state to eliminate loss of teaching time due to
        delays. By leveraging technology, streamlining the supply chain and
        fixing deadlines and accountability at every step, the Department of
        Elementary Education and the Himachal Pradesh Board of School Education
        have successfully delivered over 60 lakh textbooks across 2,100
        education clusters to over 6 lakh students in 15,000 schools before the
        commencement of the academic year in 2016. This initiative has been
        successful in each academic year since then and delivery of textbooks on
        time has become the norm in the Department.

    title: Timely Textbook delivery
  - description:
      text: More than 45,000 elementary school teachers in Himachal Pradesh are
        trained every year by Samagra Shiksha. Because of the large number of
        teachers, the government follows a cascaded model of training, delivered
        manually by master trainers. However, due to sheer scale and size, this
        in-person training can only be delivered just once a year. Therefore,
        the government designed a programme, which can provide provide relevant,
        quality training to teachers on an ongoing basis. To this end, Samagra
        Shiksha created a Refresher Training programme, in collaboration with
        The TeacherApp, an online app-based training platform. Under this
        programme, Samagra Shiksha conducted a needs assessment survey of
        teachers which directly fed into the monthly training calendar of these
        45,000+ teachers. Customized content is created every month by
        TheTeacherApp for teachers, without them having to travel for training
        sessions. Through the app a variety of content is being delivered to
        teachers every month, in the form of courses, teaching learning
        materials and the option of interacting directly with experts. At
        present, over 42,000 teachers have the app on their mobile, enabling
        them to upskill themselves and teach better.

    title: Teacher Training
  - description:
      text: Khaas Shiksha is an initiative to reward and recognize teachers on a
        monthly basis for undertaking diverse, exceptional initiatives of their
        own accord to make students learn better. This is a nomination-based
        process to identify and give due credit to well-performing teachers and
        boost their morale. It also inspires other teachers to improve their
        teaching methods, adopt innovative practices to make the teaching
        process student-centric so that learning outcomes of children improve.
        Selected teachers receive a signed letter of appreciation from the
        Director of Elementary Education and their achievement is shared through
        social media and communication platforms such as WhatsApp.

    title: Teacher Recognition
  - description:
      text: The Samarth team working with the Department of Education, Government of
        Himachal Pradesh developed and rolled out three technology products that
        will significantly change the way the state's education system operates.
        Developed exclusively for the Department of Education, these tech
        products were built using open source platforms, thus making the
        government less reliant on tech vendors. In its own way, each of the
        three products bridges the information gap in the education system which
        has traditionally made timely corrective action difficult to carry out.
        The three products are 1) a dashboard providing multi-layered analysis
        of the annual state-level assessment results of more than 5 lakh
        students allowing stakeholders at state, district and cluster level to
        make data-backed decisions; 2) a parent-involvement platform through
        which a teacher can send regular SMS updates to parents about their
        child’s attendance, homework completion status, assessment results, and
        information regarding important events in the school, and 3) a mobile
        application to track monitoring and mentoring visits by over 3,000
        officials to schools.
