overview:
  - text: Saksham Haryana, launched in 2017, successfully transformed learning
      outcomes in government schools, with 80% of students in classes 1-8
      achieving grade-level competency, or becoming 'Saksham'. Building on this
      success, the aim has now shifted to making students future-ready or
      'Kushal' through systemic reforms to ensure students in classes 6-12
      achieve grade-level competency and acquire 21st-century skills essential
      for higher education, careers, and entrepreneurship. This is being done in
      collaboration with the Department of Education, Haryana and with support
      from the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation. With a strong focus on
      institutionalizing interventions for long-term impact, for elementary
      grades the focus of Kushal Haryana is on improving classroom practices
      through assessment reforms and enabling a robust teaching learning cycle.
      For secondary grades, Kushal Haryana is working across board exam reforms,
      vocational education, and entrepreneurship enablement.

approach:
  - text: Samagra’s approach to transforming education in Haryana under Kushal
      Haryana is holistic, integrating academic and administrative reforms with
      the key focus on long-term institutionalization. On the academic front,
      the program shifts focus from rote-based learning to competency-based
      education, ensuring students achieve grade-level competency through
      assessment reforms, teaching-learning cycle, and subject-specific
      remediation. Simultaneously, administrative reforms ensure effective
      teacher competency testing & certification, structured mentoring and
      training, and data-driven monitoring mechanisms to sustain interventions
      at scale. Beyond academics, the program focuses on equipping students with
      21st-century skills, with a strong emphasis on career counselling,
      entrepreneurial mindset development, and vocational education.   A core
      principle of our approach is institutionalization for long-term
      impact—embedding interventions within government systems to ensure
      sustainability and scalability.
