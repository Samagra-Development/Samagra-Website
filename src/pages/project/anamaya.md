overview:
  - text: The STRIDE program, a part of the Tribal Health Collaborative initiated by
      the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Piramal Foundation, operates in
      partnership with Odisha's ST & SC Development Department. Its core mission
      is to enhance the health and nutrition outcomes of the state's tribal
      communities. Systemic enablers will be established under the program that
      lead to the continuous improvement in delivery of all entitlements
      fundamental to the wellbeing of tribal communities. This will be done by
      enriching the Tribal Database, a golden record of all tribal citizens,
      with high-confidence data and leveraging it to optimize the delivery of
      essential entitlements measured through the Quality of Life Index (QLI).
      The program encompasses a spectrum of interventions, from restructuring
      the MAMATA scheme to fostering access to Anganwadi Centres and enhancing
      social determinants like land rights, livelihood, and education, thereby
      paving the way for a healthier, well-nourished tribal population in
      Odisha.

approach:
  - text: Our approach to transforming tribal populationâ€™s health and nutrition
      outcomes is to establish systemic enablers such as policies, programs,
      data, tools and processes within tribal health systems. These enablers
      include the setup of a golden record of all tribal citizens, the Tribal
      Database, and leveraging it to optimize the delivery of essential
      entitlements. The Quality of Life Index (QLI), a multi-dimensional index,
      will measure saturation against a basket of 25 entitlements key to the
      health and nutrition status of a tribal household. QLI analytics will
      enable the government to maximize the saturation of existing entitlements
      by reaching out to missed eligible beneficiaries or addressing
      accessibility gaps and designing new programs/ entitlements where needed.
      QLI will set in motion the cycle of continuous improvement in health and
      nutrition outcomes. The target for 2025 will be to demonstrate the
      effectiveness of QLI as a system enabler by increasing the state-level QLI
      by 1 point.
