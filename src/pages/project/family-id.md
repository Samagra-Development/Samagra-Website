overview:
  - text: >-
      Family ID is envisioned as a database of all families residing in the
      state of Uttar Pradesh which will be linked to all citizen facing schemes
      & services provided by the government. The objective of Family ID is
      three-fold - 1. Activating proactive delivery of services 2. Ensuring
      saturation (coverage) of welfare schemes 3. Creating opportunity linkages
      for families (job/skill/credit). Samagra is co-working with the government
      on 4 major aspects â€“ 1. To onboard all families to Family ID (fresh
      registration of non-ration card holders) 2. Dynamically link all
      departmental schemes & services to Family ID 3. Identify avenues for
      opportunity/job linkages 4. Improve welfare of the families at an
      individual level and the state at a macro level to check the gap between
      schemes a family is eligible for vs which schemes they are already
      availing

approach:
  - text: >-
      The approach we are taking to solve the problem statement can be explained
      through our implementation framework consisting of 3 components -
      Enablers, Tools and Outcomes a. Enablers 1) Family Onboarding - Though
      Aadhaar has been a game changer in identifying and removing ghost
      beneficiaries of schemes, however since approx. 30-40% welfare depts are
      given to family as a unit, hence the govt. identified the need to maintain
      a database of families in the state, hence the concept of Family ID. The
      key approach followed here is to take NFSA (Ration Card) as base database
      of families and build on top of it. 2) Department Linkages - The 2nd key
      enabler is dept linkages which provides visibility to various dept.
      schemes, services and identity proofs being availed by families and
      individuals. The more linkages we are able to establish, more richness of
      data for understanding gaps in achieving maximum coverage of eligible
      beneficiaries will come across. This makes the program overarching,
      requiring coordination with all other state depts. 3) Family ID Technology
      Framework - Family ID tech platform is required to maintain Family ID as a
      live database of all families (and benefits they are availing) as well as
      run analytics to define eligibility matrix of families/individuals  b.
      Tools (Citizen and Govt. facing) Family Passbook is a citizen centric tool
      for families to do a real time check of govt schemes and services they are
      eligible for and not availing. The Family Welfare index is an internal
      department facing measurement index.
impact:

      Saturation of top 50 department schemes through near 100% beneficiary
      coverage
  - count: 
    label: Proactive delivery mechanism activated for Top 50 schemes and services
  - count: 
    label: >-
      Family passbook and welfare index being leveraged by citizens and govt
      representatives for shortlisted use cases
  - count: 
    label: >-
      No duplication of beneficiaries across 150 schemes; hence saving state
      budgets
  - count: 
    label: 5 lakh additional jobs provided through job/skilling/credit linkages
