approach:
  - text: The Young Warrior NXT program aims to help young people gain life skills
      for better academic, workplace and life outcomes. A two-pronged approach
      is being taken to achieve this goal. Through 11 tasks across 5 life skills
      on the Young Warrior NXT Bot, which was launched in August 2021, we are
      targeting 5 lakh learners within a year. Simultaneously, we are curating
      scalable pilots for imparting life skills training that require low levels
      of facilitation, deliver impact and will scale up successful solutions and
      institutionalize life skills training.
impact:
  - count: 10 lakh
    label: Youth to be engaged
  - count: 5 lakh
    label: Learners to be reached in one year
