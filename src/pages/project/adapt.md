overview:
  - text: ADAPT is a partnership between the Government of Odisha, Bill & Melinda
      Gates Foundation and Samagra aimed at increasing the agricultural output
      of the state and improving the income of farmers. The vision for the
      project is empowering the state government to make data-backed policy
      choices related to agriculture. Through this engagement we are helping
      farmers across Odisha increase their agricultural productivity by
      streamlining the supply chain of raw material, providing customised pest
      advisory services and delivering information about markets and modern
      technology. The ADAPT team works with the Government of Odisha to design
      and implement the state’s flagship KALIA scheme that provides livelihood
      assistance to small and marginal farmers across the state.

approach:
  - text: Our approach to improving agricultural productivity in Odisha is centred
      on leveraging data and technology to arm the state government and farmers
      with timely information that can translate into informed choices. This
      vision is being realized through a Decision Support System or ADAPT
      Dashboard that integrates agricultural data from multiple databases into a
      single online portal for use by government officials. This allows the
      government to make evidence-based policy decisions, pre-empt challenges
      and respond effectively to farmer needs. Through public messaging
      campaigns and extension workers, pest and weather advisories, information
      on seed treatment and soil health, irrigation and insurance is
      disseminated to farmers.

      text: The ADAPT Dashboard provides the Department of Agriculture all historical
        information needed to plan, execute, and monitor implementation of
        government schemes. Through the Dashboard the government can track the
        progress and view relevant information on a particular scheme, season,
        soil variety or crop. Farmers can use the Dashboard to access data to
        assess seasonal variations, soil health, and inputs needed.

      text: To support farmers against pest attacks, the ADAPT team has worked with
        the Government of Odisha to develop a pest surveillance app. Using this
        app, farmers can raise pest-related queries in real time. To receive
        customized solutions from agricultural experts, they just click a
        picture of the pest and share it on the app.

      text: In order to strengthen its extension workforce, the Government of Odisha
        launched a first-of-its-kind internship programme for 3rd and 4th year
        students from 3 agricultural universities. These student associates work
        as representatives of the Department of Agriculture to solve the
        information asymmetry that exists between the state and farmers. They
        work with block level officials and go on the ground to check awareness
        as well as adoption of government schemes, conduct field and impact
        assessments, collect data on pests, irrigation, seeds, etc, as well as
        farmers to create farmer profiles.
