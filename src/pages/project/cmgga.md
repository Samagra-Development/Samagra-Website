overview:
  - text: Every year 22 - 25 young professionals are recruited as CMGGAs (Chief
      Minister’s Good Governance Associates) and placed, one in each of the 22
      districts of Haryana, to co-work with DCs and the larger district
      administrations to catalyze quality implementation of 5-7 flagship
      initiatives of the Chief Minister. A Program Team (PT) from Samagra,
      stationed in the CM office, manages the program by coordinating with the
      CM and his team, collaborating with concerned departments (depending on
      the prioritized initiatives) at the state level, and overseeing the work
      and experience of CMGGAs.

approach:
  - text: Associates work on select flagship programs to address critical issues
      pertinent in their respective districts. The programme emphasizes
      professional development of associates through constant mentorship,
      including regular performance appraisals, problem-solving sessions, skills
      imparting sessions, and guidance from the Chief Minister's Office. 6 -7
      weeks of fieldwork in districts is complemented by a week-long in-person
      forum, which offers problem-solving and skill-building opportunities
      through peer learning and sharing best practices. This approach empowers
      young professionals to develop their knowledge and skills while co-working
      with district administration to drive impact across the state.

      text: Associates work with district and block education officials as well as
        teachers to ensure that the state government's educational intitiaitves
        are implemented effectively on the ground. This includes conducting
        third-party competency pre-assessment tests, driving the adoption of the
        government's teacher training and school monitoring app, implementing
        online HR management systems, among others. Associates help district
        officers make plans, organise structured reviews and consolidate
        feedback from the ground for the state government to design
        interventions.

  - description:
      text: Associates have been instrumental in making the Chief Minister's vision of
        transforming public service delivery in Haryana a reality. When the
        initiative was launched, Associates conducted a comprehensive diagnostic
        of the existing public service delivery system which brought forth its
        shortcomings. Based on this diagnosis, they then took on the task of
        revamping and standardizing the way service delivery centres operated
        across the state. Simultaneously, more than 100 services and schemes
        were brought online to the Antyodaya Saral portal. Today, the portal has
        more than 500 schemes and services across 36 government departments.
        Associates have been the driving force behind operationalizing the
        service delivery centres.

    title: Operationalizing Service Delivery
  - description:
      text: Citizens typically have to run from pillar to post to get grievances
        resolved. To this end, the Chief Minister of Haryana set up an online
        grievance monitoring system. However, this initiative also suffered from
        inefficiency and poor redressal rate. To mitigate this challenge,
        Associates established and institutionalised a weekly district level
        review mechanism which supports Deputy Commissioners in redressing
        complaints, resulting in an increased grievance disposal rate of 70-80%.
