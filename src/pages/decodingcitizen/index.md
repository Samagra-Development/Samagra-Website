  text: Decoding Citizens is a human-centered approach that involves deeply
    understanding the diverse realities, behaviors, and unmet needs of different
    citizen groups to design more effective and targeted solutions. It goes
    beyond a one-size-fits-all mindset by developing citizen
    archetypes—representative profiles that capture the unique contexts and
    experiences of various population segments. Through this process, actionable
    insights are generated to ensure that interventions are grounded in the
    real-life situations of citizens, ultimately leading to more meaningful and
    impactful governance outcomes.
