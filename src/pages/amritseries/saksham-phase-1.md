title4: What was the journey of Saksham Education Phase 1 in the Governance Matrix?
newsdescription:
  - text: In our view, the education system of Haryana, from 2017-2020 (pre-COVID),
      witnessed a shift from being 'Comatose' with low 'political salience' and
      low 'system capacity' to 'Battle Ready' with high 'political salience' and
      high 'system capacity.' The Saksham Haryana (Education) initiative,
      spearheaded by the Chief Minister, aimed to make 80% of students
      grade-level competent in the elementary grades in the state. This shift
      was propelled by increased attention to education, evident in the state's
      performance in ASER and NAS surveys. Increased political salience led to
      system capacity being built over the three-year period with reforms on the
      process, people, and infrastructural fronts.
  - text: At the process front, key changes included digitizing all education data,
      revamping assessments for competency-based learning, delivering
      competency-based remediation support, and ensuring timely textbook
      delivery. This was further complemented by cascaded and data-backed
      reviews at district and block levels. At the people front, administrative
      and academic levers were strengthened. Online and transparent teacher
      recruitment and transfers were implemented, the school mentoring cadre was
      strengthened, and teacher training was enhanced to be centered around
      pedagogy techniques for outcome achievement. At the infrastructure level,
      learning materials were upgraded and digital infrastructure was developed
      to aid the aforementioned processes. Additionally, the direct involvement
      of the Chief Minister through quarterly reviews and gamification
      strategies like Saksham Goshna fostered accountability and shared vision
      among stakeholders, making the system 'Battle Ready.'
