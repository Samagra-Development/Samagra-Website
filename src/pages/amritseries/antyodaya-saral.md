title4: What was the journey of Antyodaya Saral in the Governance Matrix?
newsdescription:
  - text: In our view, scheme and service delivery in Haryana shifted from being a
      'Sleeping Giant' with low 'political salience' and high 'system capacity'
      to 'Battle Ready' with high 'political salience' and high 'system
      capacity'. The system already had decent capacity with a well-oiled NIC
      with strong leadership and decent work on e-District implementation in the
      state under which some schemes/services had been made accessible at the
      district/subdivision/tehsil level in physical centres.
  - text: Further investment was made in system capacity, especially on the
      technology front, by building an online platform that could be used
      directly and in assisted mode. Further capacity was built on the physical
      infrastructure front, where physical centres were revamped and made
      state-of-the-art, single-window operations. Processes were put in place to
      run this strengthened system. Political salience for transforming schemes
      and service delivery in Haryana increased from 2017 to 2018, leading to
      the launch of Antyodaya Saral as an initiative which further streamlined
      scheme-service delivery in Haryana.
