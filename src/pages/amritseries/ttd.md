title4: Here is how the Haryana government worked in a mission mode to augment
  the 'political salience' and 'system capacity'
newsdescription:
  - text: ""
  - text: In our view, the timely textbook delivery under the  Samarth Programme of
      the Government of Himachal Pradesh witnessed a shift from being ‘Comatose’
      with low ‘political salience’ and low ‘system capacity’ to ‘Shooting Star’
      with high ‘political salience’ and low ‘system capacity, then to  ‘Battle
      Ready’ with high ‘political salience’ and high ‘system capacity’ over a
      period of 2 years in the years 2017 and 2018.
  - text: The timely textbook delivery initiative aimed to deliver textbooks to all
      government school students before the start of the next academic session.
  - text: Historically, there was limited focus on timely delivery of textbooks,
      with delays being common. Political salience was elevated, with the
      Principal Secretary, Department of Elementary Education, being actively
      involved. Clear goal setting was done with all system actors working
      towards the goal, thereby creating momentum for wider systemic reforms.
  - text: "Increased political salience enabled the shift from the 'Comatose' to
      'Shooting Star'; the same also being observed in the media. Following
      which system capacity was built over the next couple of months on the
      people, process and infrastructure fronts. On the people front, the roles
      and responsibilities of each official at every level were clearly defined.
      This clarity in roles allowed the initiative to be prioritized by all
      stakeholders. On the process front the supply chain of textbooks was
      reimagined, the process of demand collection was streamlined backwards
      from timeline planning and clarity in communication was ensured at all
      levels through cascaded review mechanisms. Further, district level
      workshops were conducted to ensure alignment and training of officials on
      the new standard operating procedures. On the infrastructure front,
      technological infrastructure for tracking and monitoring of textbooks was
      set up that enabled the construction of a data pipeline to generate
      real-time visibility at all levels. "
  - text: With this, in the state of Himachal Pradesh textbooks were delivered
      timely to all students for the very first time in 2017.
  - text: The increase in salience towards the initiative and improved system
      capacity on the people, process and infrastructure fronts enabled
      institutionalization of the initiative, with timely textbook delivery
      becoming the norm in the state.
