newsdescription:
  - text: In our view, the government recruitment initiative under the Saksham
      Skills & Employment programme of the Government of Haryana witnessed a
      shift from being ‘Shooting Star’ with high ‘political salience’ and low
      ‘system capacity’ to ‘Battle Ready’ with high ‘political salience’ and
      high ‘system capacity’.
  - text: The government recruitment initiative aimed to streamline the recruitment
      of Group D employees in government departments of Haryana to enhance
      efficiency and transparency.
  - text: On the political salience front, ensuring the integrity and fairness of
      the government recruitment process was a high political priority for the
      Chief Minister from the beginning. The CM’s messaging, throughout,
      maintained that the government would ensure recruitment is carried out in
      a “Bina Kharchi, Bina Parchi” manner, reflecting the high political
      salience on the subject.
  - text: System capacity – that is, people, process and infrastructure– was built
      within a year owing to high political salience. On the people front, the
      Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) was restructured with a new post
      for the Controller of Exams being sanctioned who was responsible for
      logistics, scheduling, centre management and security for examinations.
      The legal cell was also strengthened to ensure the process doesn’t get
      marred by lawsuits. On the process front, a new policy was passed in the
      Haryana legislative assembly that introduced uniform service rules for all
      Group D posts and scraped interviews in Group C & Group D. Aside from
      that, daily scrum meetings were organised  to keep every stakeholder on
      the same page and tightly manage every single thread of the exercise.
      Additionally,  document verification was made mandatory only for selected
      candidates. This collectively allowed the government to reduce the time
      taken to complete the recruitment exercise. On the infrastructure front,
      technological infrastructure was built to move HSSC’s processes online
      from physical formats which included scrutiny of candidates’ documents,
      managing requisition requests from various departments and tracking
      progress on all court cases related to HSSC.
  - text: "With this, the state of Haryana was able to cater to 18 Lakh applicants
      for Group D jobs in 2018 and fill over 45,000 positions in 18 months, as
      opposed to the 75,000 positions filled by the state in 18 years. "
