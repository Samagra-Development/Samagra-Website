title4: Where does KALIA fall in the Governance Matrix
newsdescription:
  - text: "KALIA, a scheme that pioneered Direct-Income-Transfer (DIT) to the
      landless agricultural labourers in Odisha in 2019, was a 'Shooting Star'
      on account of high 'political salience' but low 'system capacity'. High
      political backing for the scheme catalyzed the gradual development of
      system capacity on the process, people and infrastructure fronts.
      Especially the Krushak Odisha database that was developed for beneficiary
      identification for the scheme after mapping several agricultural and
      non-agricultural databases. This was supported by on-ground verification
      exercises by the administration to ensure the accuracy of the database,
      which continues to be used in the state today. "
