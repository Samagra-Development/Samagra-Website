title1: To catalyse governance with young leaders driving  innovation and impact
  in every district of Haryana.
title2: Every year 22 - 25 young professionals are recruited as CMGGAs (Chief
  Minister’s Good Governance Associates) and placed, one in each of the 22
  districts of Haryana, to co-work with District Commissioners and the larger
  district administrations to catalyze quality implementation of 5-7 flagship
  initiatives of the Chief Minister. A Program Team from Samagra, stationed in
  the CM office, manages the programme by coordinating with the CM and his team,
  collaborating with concerned departments at the state level, and overseeing
  the work and experience of CMGGAs.

title4: What was the journey of CMGGA in the Governance Matrix?
newsdescription:
  - text: "In our view, The Chief Minister’s Good Governance Associates (CMGGA)
      Programme in Haryana, witnessed a shift from being a ‘Shooting Star’ with
      high political salience and low system capacity to 'Battle Ready' with
      high political salience and high system capacity within two years since
      its inception in 2016. "
  - text: "The CMGGA Programme assigns one CMGGA (a young professional) to each of
      Haryana’s 22 districts. It has been the longest running fellowship
      programme in the country, providing young professionals a platform to
      closely work with the district administration to catalyze implementation
      of flagship initiatives of the state. "
  - text: The initial phase was characterized by high political will but limited
      system capacity that could leverage CMGGAs effectively as catalysts for
      governance outcomes. This evolved over the first 2 years as these young
      professionals were strategically positioned as “insider-outsiders” within
      the bureaucracy. This allowed the associates to bring in fresh
      perspectives and innovative solutions while leveraging existing
      governmental processes, thereby demonstrating the value they added.
      Further, to ensure the professional development of the CMGGAs, emphasis
      was placed on integrating a field-to-forum approach in the programme while
      giving sustained mentorship to the associates. Alongside this a strong
      programme team was established that ensured strategic positioning and
      structured support for the fellows placed in districts.
  - text: "The CMGGA programme’s evolution demonstrates the impact of sustained
      political will and strategic capacity building. As a result, CMGGAs were
      able to catalyze transformative and sustainable governance outcomes
      including Antyodaya Saral, Saksham Ghoshna, eOffice, Beti Bachao Beti
      Padhao and Amrit Sarovar among others. "
