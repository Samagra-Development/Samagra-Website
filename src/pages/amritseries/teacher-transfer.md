title4: What was the journey of Online Teacher Transfer in the Governance Matrix?
newsdescription:
  - text: In our view, the Online Teacher Transfer initiative under the  Saksham
      Education programme of the Government of Haryana witnessed a shift from
      being ‘Comatose’ with low ‘political salience’ and low ‘system capacity’
      to ‘Battle Ready’ with high ‘political salience’ and high ‘system
      capacity’.
  - text: The online teacher transfer initiative aimed to streamline the teacher
      transfer process in the state of Haryana to make it transparent,
      merit-driven and demand-based.
  - text: On the political salience front, a new policy was formulated and put in
      place to ensure equitable, merit-based allocation of teachers while
      balancing their preferences with demand across zones. Grievances of
      departmental stakeholders and teacher unions were redressed directly by
      the Chief Minister, building top-down political will on enabling online
      teacher transfers.
  - text: System capacity –that is, people, process and infrastructure– grew almost
      hand-in-hand with political salience. On the people front there was a
      robust bureaucratic and administrative cadre already in place.
      Additionally, a special legal team was set up headed by the district
      attorney to manage litigation action against the department and ensure its
      strong representation. On the process front data collection, cleaning, and
      updation exercises were conducted at the student, school and employee
      levels to create a point system that enabled data-backed decision-making
      which accounted for teacher preferences. Furthermore, reviews were enabled
      at all levels to ensure alignment of stakeholders involved in the process,
      with daily scrum meetings being conducted to ensure smooth execution. On
      the infrastructure front, technological infrastructure was built in the
      form of an online HR management system set up to enable teacher preference
      collection and implement rule-based assignments across the state.
  - text: With this, the state of Haryana was able to significantly curb the vacancy
      of teachers in historically vacant zones, with 94% of science stream
      schools being fully staffed, and reduced the time taken to conduct the
      whole exercise by 67% which allowed over 90,000 transfers being enabled
      over 3 years.
