    text: "2016: Laying the Foundation"
    subText: In the early months, SamagraX fostered a strong MVP culture, developing several prototypes for state governments. This included Meri Yojana, a scheme eligibility app in Haryana, and Samarth, an education transformation platform in Himachal Pradesh. During this phase, we realized the importance of understanding the factors that affect how these products are implemented within the governance ecosystem.

    text: "2017-18: Creating Initial Impact"
    subText: In this phase, SamagraX began implementing large-scale tech projects across states—supporting the Government of Haryana on Antyodaya Saral to enhance scheme delivery and Odisha’s Decision Support System to enable data-driven agricultural policymaking. These experiences revealed key challenges in deploying and sustaining tech in government, leading to a focus on building scalable, reusable, and user-friendly solutions that officials can manage independently.

    text: "2019-22: Making a Mark"
    subText: While scaling the Samarth program, SamagraX developed Shiksha Saathi, Himachal Pradesh’s first school monitoring product, later adapted in Haryana as Saksham Samiksha. These tools supported 24,000+ school visits and informed the launch of open-source solutions across education, agriculture, and skilling—reaching 55,000+ officials. Challenges during post-handover transitions led to a shift toward interoperable, easily deployable solutions integrated with government systems, such as e-Samwad, an SMS-based teacher-parent app.

    text: "2022 - Present: Exploring AI in Governance + Future Plans"
    subText: After years of leveraging technology to strengthen governance across states and sectors, SamagraX took a significant leap in 2022 with the launch of the Gov.AI Mission—an initiative to harness AI for governance. Implementing AI in India requires bridging complex technical and programmatic gaps. To address this, SamagraX developed a platform that simplifies the creation of AI-powered chatbots, assistants, and co-pilots across domains. This platform powers Krishi SahAIyak (a farmer advisory assistant in UP and Odisha) and Kumbh SahAIyak (an AI bot launched by the Prime Minister to support Mahakumbh 2025). The focus now is on enabling governments to effectively leverage technology—including AI—through strong product design and tech management.
