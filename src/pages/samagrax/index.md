    year: 2016-17
    text: Laying the Foundation
    subText: In the early months, SamagraX fostered a strong MVP culture, developing
      several prototypes for state governments. This included Meri Yojana, a
      scheme eligibility app in Haryana, and an education transformation
      platform in Himachal Pradesh for the Samarth Program. During this phase,
      we realized the importance of understanding the factors that affect how
      these products are implemented within the governance ecosystem.

    year: 2017-18
    text: Creating Initial Impact
    subText: In this phase, SamagraX began implementing large-scale tech projects
      across states—supporting the Government of Haryana on Antyodaya Saral to
      enhance scheme delivery and Odisha’s Decision Support System to enable
      data-driven agricultural policymaking. These experiences revealed key
      challenges in deploying and sustaining tech in government, leading to a
      focus on building scalable, reusable, and user-friendly solutions that
      officials can manage independently.

    text: Making a Mark
    subText: While scaling the Samarth program, SamagraX developed Shiksha Saathi,
      Himachal Pradesh’s first school monitoring product, later adapted in
      Haryana as Saksham Samiksha. These tools supported 24,000+ school visits
      and informed the launch of open-source solutions across education,
      agriculture, and skilling—reaching 55,000+ officials. Challenges during
      post-handover transitions led to a shift toward interoperable, easily
      deployable solutions integrated with government systems, such as e-Samwad,
      an SMS-based teacher-parent app.

    year: 2022-Present
    text: Exploring AI in Governance
    subText: After years of leveraging technology to strengthen governance across
      states and sectors, SamagraX took a significant leap in 2022 with the
      launch of the Gov.AI Mission—an initiative to harness AI for governance.
      Implementing AI in India requires bridging complex technical and
      programmatic gaps. To address this, SamagraX developed a platform that
      simplifies the creation of AI-powered chatbots, assistants, and co-pilots
      across domains. This platform powers Krishi SahAIyak (a farmer advisory
      assistant in UP and Odisha) and Kumbh SahAIyak (an AI bot launched by the
      Prime Minister to support Mahakumbh 2025). The focus now is on enabling
      governments to effectively leverage technology—including AI—through strong
      product design and tech management.
