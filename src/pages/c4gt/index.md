  - text: Code for GovTech (C4GT) is an ecosystem initiative to build an open-source
      community of contributors, mentors and organizations around Digital Public
      Goods (DPG), Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and Tech for Good
      products – innovations that are shaping the technological revolution
      globally to drive the mission of DPG / DPI in the attainment of the
      Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  C4GT conducts a Dedicated Mentoring
      Program (DMP) annually wherein select contributors (students or working
      professionals) work on open-source projects in the DPG / DPI / Tech for
      Good domain with 1:1 mentorship from domain experts. It is a 3-month long
      coding program offering a generous stipend to the contributor at the end
      of the program. The Dedicated Mentoring Program 2023 saw participation
      from 20+ organizations, listing 100+ problem statements spanning across 38
      different open-source products.   Beyond this, we have a community of
      14,000+ (and counting) contributors on our Discord channel, working on
      open-source products. In 2023, we also started setting up Code for GovTech
      offices to build ground-up, decentralized communities of contributors.
      Currently, we are present across 18 colleges in India, including IITs,
      IIITs and NITs.
