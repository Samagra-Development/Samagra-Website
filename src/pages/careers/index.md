      The firm is domain agnostic and takes up programs that satisfy the
      following conditions:

  - answer: Delhi is the base location for all programmes. Through the week, teams
      are stationed at the client location with frequent travel to Delhi for
      review meetings and problem solving sessions. The time spent on ground
      varies based on the engagement lifecycle. During the diagnosis phase, the
      team spends a lot of time on ground to gain a bottom up understanding of
      the problem statement and understand ground situation. In more mature
      stages of the programme, teams work at the state office to align political
      and bureaucratic leadership, with field visits as and when required.

      logical reasoning, problem-solving abilities and your communication
      skills. Some best practices here can be- 



      - If you have not done a case interview before, it is important to familiarize yourself with the basic format of case interviews 

      - Resources like preplounge and Victor Cheng’s channel on YouTube provide basic information about approaching case interviews

      - Try and understand the basics of opening a case, peeling layers of analysis and closing a case with the interviewer

      - Practicing 2-3 business cases will help you understand this 

      - Generally advisable to practice case solving in pairs with a friend or colleague

      - Do not forget that this is mostly to learn approach and structure, you will have to apply this to a governance problem
