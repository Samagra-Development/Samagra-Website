## Introduction

In a rapidly evolving job market, the need for a skilled workforce has never been more urgent. Haryana, with its significant youth population, faced a critical challenge: a mismatch between the skills possessed by its youth and the needs of industries. While the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) offered a pathway to bridge this gap, the state grappled with low awareness and adoption of apprenticeships among both youth and industries.

Under the Apprenticeship Act, 1961, two types of trades were institutionalized to make apprenticeships more inclusive and industry-relevant:

* Designated Trades: Standardized trades notified by the government, primarily focusing on engineering and manufacturing sectors. These courses are designed by the Central Staff Training and Research Institute (CSTARI) and approved by the Central Apprenticeship Council.
* Optional Trades: Flexible trades introduced to accommodate diverse industry requirements, including non-engineering sectors like retail and finance. This flexibility allowed employers to design courses as per their requirements, thereby expanding the scope of apprenticeships.

The act mandates that establishments with 30+ employees engage 2.5%-15% apprentices.

Recognizing the transformative potential of apprenticeships, [Samagra](http://samagragovernance.in), in collaboration with the Government of Haryana and Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, embarked on an ambitious mission to revitalize the apprenticeship ecosystem in the state of Haryana as a part of the [Saksham Haryana Skills & Employment programme](https://samagragovernance.in/project/saksham-employment/). This intervention not only addressed the existing bottlenecks but also set Haryana on a path to becoming a leader in skill development in the country.

## The Challenge: Gaps in Skilling and Lack of Opportunities

Despite the promise of apprenticeships, Haryana’s youth faced significant hurdles. The challenges could be broadly categorized into two fronts: citizen front and establishment front.

### Citizen Front:

* Gaps in Skilling: The traditional education system’s limited focus on practical, industry-relevant skills left many graduates ill-prepared for available jobs.
* Lack of Opportunities: The absence of structured pathways for skill acquisition and career progression hindered youth from accessing meaningful employment opportunities.

### Establishment Front:

* Lack of Awareness: Many industries, particularly small and medium enterprises, were unaware of the benefits of hiring apprentices under NAPS. The perceived complexity of the process further deterred potential employers.
* Lack of Visibility: Fragmented demand-supply linkages made it difficult for establishments to find and onboard suitable candidates efficiently, leaving a significant portion of the state’s apprenticeship potential untapped.

## Solution Design: A Comprehensive Approach

To address these challenges, a comprehensive awareness campaign was launched, emphasizing the Chief Minister’s vision of increasing apprenticeship appointments. The campaign utilized workshops and official communications to educate both government departments and industries about the benefits and procedures of NAPS. Establishments were made aware of financial incentives, including the reimbursement of 25% of the stipend upto ₹1,500 per apprentice per month by the Government of India. For the youth, the focus was on presenting apprenticeships as a practical alternative to traditional employment pathways, highlighting the advantages of hands-on experience and industry readiness.

In tandem with these awareness efforts, the appointment of nodal officers at both the headquarters and field levels played a crucial role in ensuring that apprenticeship policies were effectively communicated and implemented. These officers acted as points of contact to facilitate smooth coordination between government departments and industries, addressing bottlenecks promptly.



To further drive the adoption of apprenticeships, district-level targets were set for Assistant Apprenticeship Advisors (AAAs) based on the employee strength of government departments in each district. This targeted approach ensured that efforts were systematically aligned with the ground realities of each district, enabling a structured and scalable model for apprenticeship engagement across the state.

A robust digital tracking mechanism was also put in place using the NAPS and MSDE (Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship) portals. Initially, two separate portals were used for designated and optional trades. However, to streamline the process, the NSDC (National Skill Development Corporation) portal was declared the single point for managing both types of apprenticeships by mid-2020. This unified system allowed for real-time tracking of apprentice appointments, stipend disbursements, and contract completions.

A multi-level review system was established to ensure accountability and compliance. Semi-annual reviews by the Chief Secretary with administrative secretaries addressed policy-level challenges, while monthly reviews by the Director General of Skill Development and Industrial Training (DG SDIT) with nodal officers helped resolve operational bottlenecks. At the district level, fortnightly reviews led by District Commissioners and Assistant Apprenticeship Advisors ensured compliance on the ground. This comprehensive review mechanism not only enhanced accountability but also helped identify and resolve issues proactively, ensuring smooth execution of the apprenticeship program.



The ‘Saksham Saathi’ awards were introduced to recognize establishments that employed more than 5% of their workforce as apprentices. These awards, presented by the Chief Minister, served as a powerful incentive for private sector participation. Regular video conferences with industry representatives and sector skill councils were conducted to address their concerns and encourage participation. These sessions, chaired by the DG SDIT, helped clarify the benefits of apprenticeships and simplified the onboarding process.

In addition, data from the Labour Department was utilized to identify non-compliant establishments. Notices were issued through the District Commissioner’s office, ensuring that industries adhered to the Apprenticeship Act’s mandates. This proactive compliance monitoring significantly increased the adoption of apprenticeships in the private sector.

## Impact: Transforming Haryana’s Skilling Landscape

The comprehensive intervention led to Haryana becoming the national leader in apprentices per lakh population, achieving 440 apprentices per lakh by January 2021. Over 1.07L + apprentices were appointed between 2017 to 2020.



Haryana’s efforts were recognized nationally, earning the ‘Champion of Change’ award from the Government of India and the 2018 ‘SKOCH Order of Merit’ award for skill development driven through apprenticeships.



A [study by Aspiring Minds (now SHL)](https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/apprenticeship-training-in-haryana-shows-40-percent-improvement-in-workplace-behavioral-traits-of-iti-candidates-893024388.html) indicated a significant improvement in apprentice skills, with a 25–35% increase in English, analytical ability, and computer skills, and a 40% improvement in workplace behavior. The intervention not only enhanced employability across both public and private sectors but also set a benchmark for other states to emulate.

## Conclusion: A Blueprint for Other States

Haryana’s apprenticeship initiative serves as a blueprint for other states looking to transform their skilling ecosystems. By addressing both the demand and supply sides of the apprenticeship market and leveraging technology for tracking and monitoring, the state has set a new standard for skill development. The success of this intervention highlights the importance of public-private collaboration and the role of structured, well-communicated policies in driving large-scale impact.



As India continues its journey towards upskilling its workforce and creating meaningful employment for its workforce, replicating such models in other states could significantly accelerate this progress. Samagra’s role in enabling systemic governance reforms, focused on skill development, underscores the potential for sustainable and inclusive growth. By bridging the gap between education and industry requirements, Haryana’s apprenticeship model is not just a success story but a testament to the power of strategic governance reforms.
